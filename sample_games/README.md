For full games:
==============

The suffixes contain letters `i` or `x` depending on whether the file
	- `i` includes something
	- `x` does not include something

The suffixes are two letters long: `xx`, `ix`, `xi`, `ii`:
	- The first letter corresponds to comments,
	- The second letter corresponds to variants.

For small games:
===============

The format for their filenames is just a four-digit number, starting at `0000` and increasing in steps of value 1. A file may have a variant suffixed with `-r` to indicate that it contains a result.
